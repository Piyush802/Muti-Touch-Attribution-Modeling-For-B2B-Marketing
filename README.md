# Muti-Touch-Attribution-Modeling-For-B2B-Marketing

## 📖 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing multi-channel customer journeys and determining the true contribution of marketing channels using multiple attribution models.
The goal is to move beyond traditional single-touch attribution and 
provide data-driven insights for marketing budget optimization.

## 🎯 Objectives

1. Analyze customer journeys across multiple marketing channels
2. Implement and compare multiple attribution models
3. Identify under- and over-valued marketing channels
4. Build interactive dashboards for business decision-making

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

#### Python: Data processing, attribution modeling
#### Power BI: Interactive dashboards & visualization
#### Pandas / NumPy: Data manipulation
#### Markov Chains: Probabilistic attribution modeling

## 📊 Attribution Models Implemented

1. First Touch Attribution
2. Last Touch Attribution
3. Linear Attribution
4. Time Decay Attribution
5. Markov Attribution (Removal Effect)

## 📈 Dashboard Features

1.Model selector (First / Last / Linear / Time Decay / Markov)
2. Channel-wise attribution comparison
3. Conversion & revenue KPIs
4. Customer journey length analysis
5. Drill-through to lead-level journeys

## 🔍 Key Insights

#### Different attribution models significantly change channel valuation.
#### Awareness channels are undervalued in last-touch models.
#### Markov attribution provides a more realistic contribution analysis.
#### Budget reallocation based on insights can improve ROI.

## ⚠️ Limitations

#### Synthetic dataset used.
#### No cost-level ROI modeling.
#### Offline channels not included.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

#### Shapley value attribution.
#### Cost-based ROI optimization.
#### Real-time data integration.
